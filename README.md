5th homework assignment
## Description 

This is my 5th homework assigment. In addition to the code provided, I added both HTML and JavaScript to this project.

The application displays the current date and time at the top of the page.
This application will present the user with timeblocks, with which the user will input value. 
The user input value will be saved to localStorage when the "save btn" is clicked on the left side of the hour block
Each hour block has a "save btn"
The application takes in the current time, and highlights corresponding time blocks depending on if those time blocks are in the present, past or future relative to the CURRENT TIME.
WHen the page is refreshed, the information in the time blocks will persist. 





## Installation

To install the application, the first thing I did was make the time/hour/user input elements using bootstrap. The bootstrap CDN was given so I figured this was appropriate. I used pseudocode to figure out the functionality for my application step by step. 

The ability to input in the given timeblocks is allowed through the HTML elements.
I used the JavaScript to:

1) save to localStorage so refreshing does not delete data
2) save button is a click event, firing a function to save the data in localStorage.
3) my js file also dictates the color of the time blocks relative to the current time by changing the CSS class associated with them
4) Js is also responsible for the time and date stamp at the top of the page




## Usage 

If you dont have a phone or dont know how to write using pen and paper, come use my Workday scheduler so you can know when things need to get done.
