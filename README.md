# Homework5WorkPlanner
5th homework assignment
## Description 

This is my 5th homework assigment. In addition to the code provided, I added both HTML and JavaScript to this project.

I rendered the hour elements and timeblock through HTML because they did not need to be made dynamically.
The input of the user in each given hour element is also stored locally once the save button on the side of the hour is clicked. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

* [Usage](#usage)
* [Credits](#credits)
* [License](#license)


## Installation

To install the application, the first thing I did was make the time/hour/user input elements using bootstrap. The bootstrap CDN was given so I figured this was appropriate. I used pseudocode to figure out the functionality for my application step by step. 

Pseudo




## Usage 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed. 


## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.



## License

The last section of a good README is a license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, use [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.


## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
